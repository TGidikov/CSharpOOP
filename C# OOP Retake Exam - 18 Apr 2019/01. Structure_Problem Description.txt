C# OOP Retake Exam - 18 April 2019
Overview
PlayersAndMonsters is a battle game. It's all about battles between players with their cards. Each player has health and deck of cards. Each card gives bonus damage and bonus health. The players fight on the battle field with their cards.
Setup
•	Upload only the PlayersAndMonsters project in every problem except Unit Tests
•	Do not modify the interfaces or their namespaces
•	Use strong cohesion and loose coupling
•	Use inheritance and the provided interfaces wherever possible. This includes constructors, method parameters and return types
•	Do not violate your interface implementations by adding more public methods or properties in the concrete class than the interface has defined
•	Make sure you have no public fields anywhere
Task 1: Structure (50 points)
You are given 7 interfaces, and you have to implement their functionality in the correct classes.
There are 3 types of entities in the application: Player, Card and BattleField:
Player
Player is a base class for any type of player and it should not be able to be instantiated.
Data
•	Username – string (If the username is null or empty, throw an ArgumentException with message "Player's username cannot be null or an empty string. ")
•	Health – the health of а player (if the health is below 0, throw an ArgumentException with message "Player's health bonus cannot be less than zero. ")
•	CardRepository – repository of all user's cards.
•	IsDead – calculated property which returns bool.
Behavior
void TakeDamage(int damagePoints)
The TakeDamage method decreases players' points. 
•	If the damagePoints are below 0 throw an ArgumentException with message "Damage points cannot be less than zero."
•	Player’s health should not drop below zero
Constructor
A Player should take the following values upon initialization: 
ICardRepository cardRepository, string username, int health 
Child Classes
There are several concrete types of players:
Beginner
Has 50 initial health points.
Constructor should take the following values upon initialization:
ICardRepository cardRepository, string username 
Advanced
Has 250 initial health points.
Constructor should take the following values upon initialization:
ICardRepository cardRepository, string username 
Card
The Card is a base class for any type of card and it should not be able to be instantiated.
Data
•	Name – string (If the card name is null or empty throw an ArgumentException with message "Card's name cannot be null or an empty string.") 
•	DamagePoints – int (If the damage points are below zero, throw an ArgumentException with message "Card's damage points cannot be less than zero.") 
•	HealthPoints - int (If the health points are below zero, throw an ArgumentException with message "Card's HP cannot be less than zero.") 
Constructor
A Card should take the following values upon initialization: 
string name, int damagePoints, int healthPoints 
Child Classes
There are several concrete types of cards:
MagicCard
Has 5 damage points and 80 health points.
Constructor should take the following values upon initialization:
string name
TrapCard
Has 120 damage points and 5 health points.
Constructor should take the following values upon initialization:
string name
BattleField
The battle field is the place where the fight happens.
Behavior
void Fight(IPlayer attacker, IPlayer enemy)
That's the most interesting method. 
•	If one of the users is dead, throw new ArgumentException with message "Player is dead!"
•	If the player is a beginner, increase his health with 40 points and increase all damage points of all cards for the user with 30.
•	Before the fight, both players get bonus health points from their deck.
•	Attacker attacks first and after that the enemy attacks. If one of the players is dead you should stop the fight.
PlayerRepository
The player repository holds information for all users.
Data
•	Count – int – the count of players
•	Players – collection of players (unmodifiable)
Behavior
void Add(IPlayer player)
Adds a player in the collection.
•	If the player is null, throw an ArgumentException with message "Player cannot be null".
•	If a player exists with a name equal to the name of the given player, throw an ArgumentException with message "Player {username} already exists!".
bool Remove(IPlayer player)
Removes a player from the collection.
•	If the player is null, throw an ArgumentException with message "Player cannot be null".
IPlayer Find(string username)
Returns a player with that username.
CardRepository
The card repository holds information for all cards.
Data
•	Count – int – the count of cards
•	Cards – collection of cards (unmodifiable)
Behavior
void Add(ICard card)
Adds a card in the collection.
•	If the card is null, throw an ArgumentException with message "Card cannot be null!".
•	If a card exists with a name equal to the name of the given card, throw an ArgumentException with message "Card {name} already exists!".
bool Remove(ICard card)
Removes a card from the collection.
•	If the card is null, throw an ArgumentException with message "Card cannot be null!".
ICard Find(string name)
Returns a card with that name.

Task 2: Business Logic (150 points)
The Controller Class
The business logic of the program should be concentrated around several commands. You are given interfaces, which you have to implement in the correct classes.
Note: The ManagerController class SHOULD NOT handle exceptions! The tests are designed to expect exceptions, not messages!
The first interface is IManagerController. You must create a ManagerController class, which implements the interface and implements all of its methods. The given methods should have the following logic:
Commands
There are several commands, which control the business logic of the application. They are stated below.
AddPlayer Command
Parameters
•	Type - string
•	Username – string
Functionality
Creates a player with the provided type and name. The method should return the following message:
"Successfully added player of type {type} with username: {username}"
AddCard Command
Parameters
•	Type - string
•	Name - string
Functionality
Creates a card with the provided type and name. The method should return the following message:
"Successfully added card of type {type}Card with name: {name}"
AddPlayerCard Command
Parameters
•	Username - string
•	CardName - string
Functionality
Adds the given card to the user card repository. The method should return the following message:
"Successfully added card: {cardName} to user: {userName}"
Fight Command
Parameters
•	AttackPlayer - string
•	EnemyPlayer – string
Functionality
Sends the attacker player and enemy player to the battle field. The method should return the following message:
"Attack user health {attack player} - Enemy user health {enemy player}"
Report Command
Functionality
Returns a report message in format:
"Username: {username} - Health: {health} – Cards {cards count}"
"Card: {name} - Damage: {card damage}"
"###" 
Input / Output
You are provided with one interface, which will helps with the correct execution process of your program. The interface is IEngine and the class implementing this interface should read the input and when the program finishes, this class should print the output.
Input
Below, you can see the format in which each command will be given in the input:
•	AddPlayer {player type} {player username}
•	AddCard {card type} {card name}
•	AddPlayerCard {username} {card name}
•	Fight {attack user} {enemy user}
•	Report
Output
Print the output from each command when issued. If an exception is thrown during any of the commands’ execution, print the exception message.

Task 3: Unit Tests (100 points)
You will receive a skeleton with SoftPark and Car classes inside. The class will have some methods, properties, fields and one constructor, which are working properly. You are NOT ALLOWED to change any class. Cover the whole class with unit tests to make sure that the class is working as intended. 
You are provided with a unit test project in the project skeleton. DO NOT modify its NuGet packages.
Note: The SoftPark you need to test is in the global namespace, so remove any using statements, pointing towards the namespace ParkingSystem.
Do NOT use Mocking in your unit tests!
